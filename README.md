Scalability:
A dedicated admin panel facilitates easier scalability and expansion of administrative features as the website grows. New functionalities can be added without affecting the user interface of the main website, ensuring a seamless experience for regular users

Customization:
An admin panel can be customized to suit the specific needs of administrators. It offers tailored functionalities and insights without impacting the design or performance of the main website. This customization enhances the efficiency of administrative tasks.

Maintenance:
Separating the admin panel and main website simplifies maintenance tasks. Updates, patches, or changes to the admin interface can be implemented without affecting the public-facing components of the site. This separation of concerns makes maintenance more straightforward.

Organization:
